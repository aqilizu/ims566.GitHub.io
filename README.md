IMS566 Individual Project: UiTM Library Management System InterfaceThe UiTM Library Management System Interface is a web based application prototype designed to demonstrate proficiency in advanced web design principles, client side content management, and responsive layout, fulfilling the requirements for the IMS566 Individual Project. The system is built using Bootstrap 5 for a professional and fully responsive UI, and Vanilla JavaScript (app.js) handles all client-side logic. Key features include Login (index.html) and Registration (register.html) pages with simulated authentication and validation, persisting data using localStorage. The Dashboard (dashboard.html) serves as the landing page, displaying system summaries via cards and featuring the required visual element: a Chart.js Bar Chart visualizing borrowed books by category. Content management is demonstrated through the Books List (books.html), which features a responsive, searchable, and sortable table, and the My Profile (users.html) page, which allows users to view and update their details via a functional modal. The entire application maintains a consistent, UiTM-themed navigation bar that correctly functions as a responsive burger menu on mobile devices
